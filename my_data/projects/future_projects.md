# Future Project Ideas & Interests

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring and building sophisticated AI/ML systems. My future project interests include:

-   **Advanced Generative AI Applications:** Exploring the fine-tuning of open-source LLMs on specific domains (if compute resources become available) or building more complex agents that can perform multi-step tasks using LLMs, potentially involving tool use or interaction with external APIs.
-   **Reinforcement Learning in Robotics or Simulations:** Applying Reinforcement Learning techniques to control robots or agents in complex simulation environments, focusing on areas like pathfinding, manipulation, or autonomous decision-making. This would combine my interests in AI and engineering/hardware.
-   **Ethical AI and Bias Detection:** Developing tools or methodologies to analyze and mitigate bias in AI models, particularly in sensitive applications like hiring or lending, contributing to fairer AI systems.
-   **Optimized AI for Edge/Specialized Hardware:** Further work on deploying and optimizing AI models for low-power or specialized hardware (like TPUs, NPUs, or microcontrollers), expanding on my ASL project experience. This involves model quantization, pruning, and efficient architecture design.
-   **Big Data ML Pipelines at Scale:** Designing and implementing more complex, production-ready ML pipelines using distributed computing frameworks (Spark, Dask) and cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure) for large-scale data processing and model training, building on my Fish Species project experience.

I am eager to apply my skills in roles that involve these areas and contribute to cutting-edge AI development.
