**Project Role:** Author/Sole Developer
Project Date: [Jan 2025 - Feb 2025]

**Project Goal:** To create a professional, responsive, and visually appealing personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and experience to potential employers. This website also serves as a platform to integrate interactive AI demonstrations like the AI Assistant chatbot.

**Technologies Used:** The frontend of this portfolio website was built from scratch using **React**. Styling was primarily handled using **Tailwind CSS**. The site is hosted and deployed on **Vercel**.
