# About This AI Portfolio Assistant

This chatbot is an interactive demonstration of Mohammed Khan's skills in Artificial Intelligence and full-stack development. Its purpose is to provide instant, conversational answers to questions about his professional background, projects, skills, and experience, based *only* on the information Mohammed has provided about himself.

**Technical Architecture & Implementation:**

The chatbot utilizes a **Prompt Stuffing** architecture, which is a modern approach for making Large Language Models (LLMs) knowledgeable about specific, private datasets without requiring expensive and time-consuming fine-tuning of the model itself.

-   **Data Handling:** All of Mohammed Khan's relevant personal information (details about education, professional experience, projects, skills, background, etc.) is stored in simple, structured text files (.md and .txt) within a `my_data` directory.
-   **Backend (Flask on Hugging Face Spaces):** The core logic runs on a **Python Flask** application. At startup, this application reads *all* the text content from the files in the `my_data` directory and consolidates it into a single large string. This Flask app is **containerized using Docker** and deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**, providing a free and accessible cloud environment.
-   **Prompt Construction:** When a user asks a question via the chat interface, the backend Flask application takes the user's question and combines it with the *entire consolidated personal data string* into a carefully crafted prompt. This prompt includes strict instructions for the LLM, specifically telling it to answer *only* based on the provided personal data and to state when it doesn't have enough information *from that data*.
-   **LLM Interaction:** The backend sends this comprehensive prompt to the **Google Gemini API** (using the `gemini-1.5-flash` model, known for its balance of capability and speed). The backend is configured to handle the API call, including timeouts and error handling.
-   **Frontend (React on Vercel):** The chat interface is a React component integrated into Mohammed Khan's existing portfolio website, which is hosted on **Vercel**. It communicates with the backend API via standard **Fetch API** calls. The frontend is designed to display messages and handle the **streaming response** from the backend, creating a smooth, character-by-character typing animation.
-   **UI/Animations:** **Framer Motion** is used for sleek animations on the chat interface (opening/closing, message entry) and on the floating icon and page indicator to enhance user engagement. Styling is primarily handled using **Tailwind CSS**, integrated into the React application.

**Why Prompt Stuffing vs. RAG?**

While **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** was initially explored for this project (which involves using embeddings and a vector database like FAISS to retrieve only the *most relevant* chunks of data for a given query before sending them to the LLM), the Prompt Stuffing approach was ultimately chosen for this specific portfolio project due to key considerations:

-   **Ease of Update:** For a personal portfolio where data updates (like adding a new job or project) are frequent, directly updating simple text files and re-uploading the `my_data` folder is significantly simpler and faster than having to re-run the entire embedding and FAISS indexing pipeline in Colab with each update required by a RAG system.
-   **Data Size:** The total volume of personal data for a portfolio typically remains well within the context window limits of powerful modern LLMs like Gemini. For this scale, the complexity of maintaining a separate RAG index is not necessary for performance or cost optimization.
-   **Leveraging LLM Capability:** Prompt Stuffing leverages the LLM's inherent ability to read and synthesize information from a large provided text, making the LLM responsible for finding the answer within the full document context.

This project demonstrates the ability to build full-stack AI applications, handle custom data integration, make pragmatic technical decisions based on project scope and constraints, and deploy solutions on cloud platforms.

# About This AI Portfolio Assistant: Engineering Deep Dive

This chatbot stands as a testament to Mohammed Khan's ability to design, build, and deploy sophisticated Artificial Intelligence solutions within real-world constraints. Its primary function is to serve as an interactive knowledge base, enabling recruiters and interested parties to gain instant, conversational insights into Mohammed's diverse professional background, projects, skills, and technical expertise, drawing *exclusively* from the comprehensive data he has curated about himself.

**Navigating Architectural Choices:**

The development involved critical decisions regarding the underlying AI architecture. While **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** was initially explored – a standard approach for handling large, dynamic datasets by retrieving relevant document snippets using vector databases (like FAISS) and embeddings (from models like Sentence Transformers) before querying an LLM – a pragmatic pivot was made for this specific portfolio project.

Recognizing that the total volume of personal data, while detailed, remains well within the context window capabilities of advanced modern LLMs, the **Prompt Stuffing** strategy was adopted. This deliberate choice prioritizes ease of maintenance and leverages the raw processing power of the LLM for data synthesis, without requiring the overhead of managing a separate retrieval index pipeline for this dataset size. This decision highlights an understanding of architectural trade-offs based on project scope and resource constraints – a key skill in AI engineering.

**Technical Stack & Implementation:**

The backend of this interactive assistant is a **Python Flask** application, engineered for robust handling of incoming queries. This application is tasked with reading, consolidating, and structuring all of Mohammed Khan's personal data (painstakingly curated into simple text files) into a single, comprehensive context string at startup.

This backend logic is **containerized using Docker**, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment. The Docker container is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**, utilizing its free tier to provide a publicly accessible API endpoint.

For the generative capabilities, the backend integrates with the **Google Gemini API** (specifically the `gemini-1.5-flash` model). This integration involves carefully crafting a single, large prompt that includes the user's real-time question alongside the *entire consolidated personal data*. The prompt is engineered with strict instructions and constraints, compelling Gemini to answer *solely* based on the provided information and gracefully handle queries outside this scope by stating it lacks sufficient data. This prompt engineering is crucial to ensure the bot remains focused and factual about Mohammed's profile. Error handling and timeouts for the API calls are implemented within the backend to ensure robustness.

The frontend is seamlessly integrated into Mohammed Khan's existing **React** portfolio website, which is deployed on **Vercel**. The chat interface is built as a dedicated React component that communicates with the Flask backend via standard **Fetch API** calls. A key frontend feature is the implementation of **response streaming**, enabling a smooth, character-by-character typing animation for the AI's answers, enhancing user engagement.

The user interface and visual design are polished using **Tailwind CSS**, providing a sleek, modern look consistent with the portfolio's theme. **Framer Motion** is utilized to add dynamic animations to the chat interface elements and the floating visibility indicator, subtly guiding the user's interaction.

**Project Highlights:**

-   **Pragmatic Architectural Choice:** Demonstrates understanding of RAG vs. Prompt Stuffing trade-offs for dataset scale and maintainability.
